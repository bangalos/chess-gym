Title	Art Of Planning In Chess
Description	Planning is the process by which a player utilizes the advantages and minimizes the drawbacks of his position. In order to promise success, planning is thus always based on diagnosis of the existing charesteristics of the position; it is therefore most difficult when the position is evenly balanced, and easiest when there is only one plan to satisfy the demands of the position. Planlessness always gets punished.
