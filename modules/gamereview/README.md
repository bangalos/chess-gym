Game Review
===========

Game review methodology encoder

Instructions
------------

This module encodes the "Game Review" methodology.

The games are present in ~files/game_review folder. For instance, the games from The Art Of Sacrifice.

The reason for creating this module is that I could not find an efficient way of reviewing the games. While videos do a good job of explaining the moves in detail, and chess engines allow the game to be reviewed in the training mode, I wanted a web based tool that would let me access and review the games from anywhere in training mode while also giving me a score on how well I remembered it. Basically, all the good methodology that you could do on your own if you were disciplined, but encoding the discipline in the program itself.

Attention
---------

This module is a work in progress. Please report bugs and suggestions, ok?
