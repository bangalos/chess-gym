Chess think
===========

Chess thinking methodology encoder

Instructions
------------

This module encodes the "chess thinking" methodology.

At its core, the chess game engine is a javascript based engine inspired by Bluefever.net youtube series.

We are enveloping it with Drupal goodness to record user thoughts through forms. In example.com/think, the user can kickoff a new thinking session. Basically, the user is playing a game of chess from a position.

In example.com/review, the user can review the thoughts from his games.

We need to store username, game name, fen of the position, thoughts of the users, timestamp of the record beginning, timestamp of the thought ending.

Attention
---------

This module is a work in progress. Please report bugs and suggestions, ok?
