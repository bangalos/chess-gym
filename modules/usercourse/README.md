User Course Navigation And Progress

Instructions
------------

This module encodes the "User Course Navigation And Progress" methodology.

The games are present in ~files/game_review/course_name folder. For instance, the games from The Art Of Sacrifice are present in ~files/chessgym/gamereview/rudolf_spielmann/ folder. The games themselves are in the files named game_1, game_2 ..., game_37.

In addition to the games, there is an overview.txt file. It is a tab delimited text file that contains metadata about the folder.

This module will read the overview and create a page based on the metadata. It will also include whether the user has completed the individual positions eventually.
